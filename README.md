This is my first project using Python after studying some courses on [DataCamp.com](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/data-scientist-with-python)

You can find the App here: [davidfernandez.dev](http://davidfernandez.dev). It's deployed on Heroku following [this tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/data-scientist-with-python)https://dash.plotly.com/deployment).

The data comes from [Wyscout](https://wyscout.com/). I used the trial version to get the data for my personal training. I cannot afford the full license, so I'm looking forward to working in a company using using this data.

Contant me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-fernandez-11a715170/). Looking for my first job as Data Analyst :)
